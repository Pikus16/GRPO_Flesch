The original value of the house was $80,000, and the repairs increased its value by 150%. This means the value of the repairs is 150% of $80,000, which is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. The total value of the house after repairs is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. Since Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, his profit is the difference between the new value of the house and the cost of repairs, which is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the profit, not the total value of the house after repairs. So, the profit is $150,000.\n\nANSWER\n150000", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total meters James runs a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint session and then multiply it by the number of sessions he runs in a week. \nSince James runs 3 sprints in one session, and each sprint is 60 meters, the total meters he runs in one session is 3 * 60 = 180 meters. \nSince James runs 3 sessions a week, the total meters he runs a week is 180 * 3 = 540 meters.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n540\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total number of cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we need to calculate the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals, then subtract that from the total number of cups of feed given in a day. \nFirst, we know that each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per meal. Since there are 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed given in a day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups. \nIn the morning, Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens 25 cups of feed. So the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. \nNow, we need to subtract the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon meals from the total number of cups of feed given in a day to find the number of cups of feed given in the final meal. \n60 - 40 = 20 cups.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n20\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * $5 = $3. Since the price of the second glass is $3, the price of the third glass will be 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * $3 = $1.8. We can see that the price of each glass decreases by 40% each time. So, the price of the glasses will be $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.64, $0.384, $0.2304, $0.13824, $0.082944, $0.0497664, $0.02986496, $0.017949472, $0.010797888, $0.006478293, $0.0038697664, $0.00232687888. We can add these prices together to find the total cost. However, there is a simpler way to calculate this. The price of the glasses forms a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 0.6. The sum of a geometric sequence can be calculated using the formula S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms. In this case, a = $5, r = 0.6, and n = 16. Plugging in these values, we get S = $5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6). Calculating 0.6^16 gives us 0.00000244140625. Plugging this into the formula, we get S = $5 * (1 - 0.00000244140625) / (1 - 0.6) = $5 * 0.99999755859375 / 0.4 = $6.249892322265625.

Since Carla can download 2 GB/minute, the time it takes to download 160 GB (80% of 200 GB) is 160 / 2 = 80 minutes.\n\nNext, we add the time it takes to install the updates, which is 20 minutes.\n\nFinally, we calculate the time it takes to download the remaining 20% of the file, which is 40 GB (20% of 200 GB). The time it takes to download this is 40 / 2 = 20 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time it takes to download the file is 80 + 20 + 20 = 120 minutes.\n\n<answer>\n120\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo solve this problem, we need to break it down into two parts: the distance John covers while driving to the point where he turns around, and the distance he covers while driving back home.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the distance John covers while driving to the point where he turns around. He drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance covered is given by the formula distance = speed * time. So, distance = 60 * 3 = 180 miles.\n\nNow, let's calculate the distance John covers while driving back home. He spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then, he drives at a speed of 30 mph for half an hour, which is 0.5 hours. The distance covered during this time is 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles. After that, he drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining 2 hours. The distance covered during this time is 80 * 2 = 160 miles.\n\nThe total distance John covers while driving back home is the sum of the distances covered during the two segments: 15 + 160 = 175 miles.\n\nSince John is driving back home, we need to subtract the distance he covered while driving to the point where he turns around from the total distance he covers while driving back home. This will give us the distance he is from home at the end of the 4 hours. So, the distance from home is 175 - 180 = -5 miles. However, since distance cannot be negative, we need to take the absolute value of this result.\n\nThe absolute value of -5 is 5 miles.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n5\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours. \nFirst, we calculate her earnings for the first 40 hours: 40 hours * $10/hour = $400.\nNext, we calculate her overtime hours: 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours.\nHer overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime pay rate is $10 * 1.2 = $12/hour.\nNow, we calculate her earnings for the overtime hours: 5 hours * $12/hour = $60.\nFinally, we add her earnings for the first 40 hours and the overtime hours to get her total earnings: $400 + $60 = $460.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n460\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total number of downloads over the three months, we need to calculate the downloads for each month and then add them together. \nIn the first month, the program had 60 downloads. \nIn the second month, the number of downloads was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads. \nIn the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30% from the second month. 30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54.

Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is x/3. She sold 2 more at the red house. After that, she had (x - x/3 - 2) vacuum cleaners left. Then, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2. After selling at the orange house, she had (x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2) vacuum cleaners left. We are given that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. So, we can set up the equation: x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5. To solve for x, we need to simplify the equation. First, we can multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction: 6(x - x/3 - 2 - (x - x/3 - 2)/2) = 6(5). This simplifies to 6(x - x/3 - 2 - (2x - 2)/2) = 30. Multiply the terms inside the parentheses: 6(x - x/3 - 2 - x + 1) = 30. Combine like terms: 6(2x/3 - 1) = 30. Distribute the 6: 4x - 6 = 30. Add 6 to both sides: 4x = 36.

The pineapple drink is three-fifths water, so the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters.\n\nThe total amount of water in the original 25 liters (10 liters of orange drink + 15 liters of pineapple drink) is 20/3 + 9 = 43/3 liters.\n\nWhen 1 liter of the orange drink is spilled, the amount of water spilled is (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 liters. So, the amount of water left in the 24 liters is 43/3 - 2/3 = 41/3 liters.\n\nTo convert this to a decimal, we can divide 41 by 3, which is approximately 13.67. However, since the question asks for the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to find the total amount of water in the 24 liters. \n\nThe amount of water in the 24 liters is the sum of the water in the remaining 10 liters of orange drink and the 14 liters of pineapple drink.

This can be calculated by dividing the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days by 4. 60 / 4 = 15 sets of yogurts. \nNow, we multiply the number of sets by the price per set to find the total cost. 15 * $5.00 = $75.00\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n75\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets. Since he sold 13 sets at $15 each, the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195. Then, he bought 8 video games at $20 each, which costs 8 * 20 = $160. After buying the video games, he had $5 left. So, the amount of money he had before buying the video games is $195 + $5 = $200. Since he spent $160 on video games, the amount of money he had after selling the Lego sets but before buying the video games is $200 - $160 = $40. However, this is not the amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. Since he made $195 from selling the Lego sets, we need to find out how many sets he sold to get $40. If he made $40 from selling some of the Lego sets, then the number of sets he sold is 40 / 15 = 2.67. Since John can't sell a fraction of a Lego set, he must have sold 2 sets to get $40. So, the number of sets he still has is 13 - 2 = 11.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n11\n</answer>", "To find John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance John runs in a week. He runs 60 miles a week.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total time John spends running in a week. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days. The total time he spends running is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.\n\nNow, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time: speed = distance / time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.\n\n<reasoning>\nTo find John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running.

We know that her skipping speed is 3 miles per hour, which is half of her running speed. So, her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. Since her running speed is four times her walking speed, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.\n\nNow, we need to find out how much time she spends running and walking in six hours. She spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours. She spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance she travels while running and walking. The distance she travels while running is 6 * 2 = 12 miles.

Since Marcy works for 30 years, she gets the full pension for 10 years (30 - 20 = 10) and the increased pension for 20 years (30 - 20 = 10). \n\nThe total value of the pension after 30 years is the sum of the value of the full pension for 10 years and the value of the increased pension for 20 years. \n\nThe value of the full pension for 10 years is 10 * $50,000 = $500,000. \n\nThe value of the increased pension for 20 years is 20 * $50,000 * 0.05 = $50,000. \n\nThe total value of the pension after 30 years is $500,000 + $50,000 = $550,000.\n\nNow, we need to find 5% of the total value of the pension after 30 years. 5% of $550,000 is $550,000 * 0.05 = $27,500.\n\nThe annual pension after 30 years is the sum of the full pension and the increased pension, which is $50,000 + $27,500 = $77,500.\n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n77500\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year. \n\nThe first half of the year is 6 months, so the amount she paid for the first half is 6 * $140 = $840. \n\nThe amount she paid for the second half of the year is 10% less than $140, which is 0.9 * $140 = $126. \n\nThe amount she paid for the second half of the year is $126 * 6 = $756. \n\nThe total amount she paid for the year is $840 + $756 = $1596. \n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n1596\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We know that Sophia put in 4 gallons of gas to fill up her tank, and she had already traveled 100 miles. Since the tank holds 12 gallons, we can calculate the total distance she can drive on a full tank by first finding the car's mpg rating. We can do this by dividing the distance she traveled by the amount of gas she used. mpg = distance / gas = 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Since $0.5 is less than $0.8333, the package of 2 flowers is the better price. To find the cost of 18 flowers at the better price, we multiply the cost per flower by the number of flowers: 18 * $0.5 = $9. To find the cost of 18 flowers at the original price, we multiply the cost per flower by the number of flowers: 18 * $0.8333 = $15.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so W + L = 22. We also know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so W = L + 8. We can substitute the second equation into the first one: L + 8 = L + 22. Subtracting L from both sides gives us 8 = 22. This is incorrect, so we need to re-evaluate our equations. The correct equations should be W + L = 22 and W = L + 8. We can rewrite the second equation as W - L = 8. Now we can solve the system of equations by adding the two equations: (W + L) + (W - L) = 22 + 8, which simplifies to 2W = 30.

Since the other pair costs twice as much, its cost is 2x. Together, they cost 5 dollars less than the boots. So, x + 2x = boots + 5. This simplifies to 3x = boots + 5. We also know that one pair of heels costs $33. Since it's the less expensive pair, we can set up the equation 2x = 33. Solving for x, we get x = 33 / 2 = 16.5. Now we can substitute this value into the equation 3x = boots + 5. 3 * 16.5 = boots + 5. 49.5 = boots + 5.

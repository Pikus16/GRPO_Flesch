[["<reasoning>\nTo find out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market, we need to calculate the number of eggs she sells and multiply it by the price per egg. \n\nFirst, we need to find out how many eggs Janet uses for baking muffins and eating. She eats 3 eggs and bakes 4 eggs every day. So, she uses 3 + 4 = 7 eggs.\n\nSince she lays 16 eggs per day, we subtract the eggs she uses from the total number of eggs laid. 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left.\n\nSince she sells the remainder at $2 per egg, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg. 9 * 2 = 18.\n\nSo, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n18\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total number of bolts of white fiber, we need to calculate half of the bolts of blue fiber.

Since the repairs increased the value of the house by 150%, we can calculate the new value by adding 150% of the original value to the original value.\n\nThe original value of the house is $80,000. 150% of $80,000 is 1.5 * $80,000 = $120,000. Adding this to the original value gives us $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.\n\nHowever, Josh also put in $50,000 in repairs, so we need to subtract this from the new value to find the actual profit. The profit is $200,000 - $50,000 = $150,000.\n\nHowever, Josh also spent $80,000 to buy the house, so we need to subtract this from the profit to find the final profit.

Distance = speed * time. So, distance = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the remaining distance to home after John turns around.\nSince John is trying to get home in 4 hours, and he has already spent 3 hours driving to the point of return, he has 4 - 3 = 1 hour of driving time left to get home. However, he spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he effectively has 1 - 2 = -1 hour of driving time left to get home. Since you cannot have a negative hour, this means he will not be able to make it home in 4 hours. However, we will continue with the problem as given.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the distance John traveled in the first half-hour after turning around.\nJohn drives at a speed of 30 mph for the first half-hour.

This can be calculated by dividing the total number of yogurts he eats in 30 days by 4. 60 / 4 = 15 sets of yogurts. \nNow, we multiply the number of sets by the cost per set to find the total cost. 15 sets * $5.00 per set = $75.00.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n$75.00\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find out how many Lego sets John still has, we need to first calculate how much money he made from selling the Lego sets and then subtract the cost of the video games he bought. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets: 13 Lego sets * $15 per set = $195.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total amount of money John spent on video games: 8 video games * $20 per game = $160.\n\nNow, let's calculate how much money John had left after buying the video games: $195 - $160 = $35.\n\nHowever, the problem states that John had $5 left after buying the video games. This means that the $35 we calculated is actually the amount of money John had after buying the video games, but before buying the last Lego set. Since John had $5 left after buying the video games, he must have spent $30 on the last Lego set.\n\nNow, let's calculate how many Lego sets John sold: $30 / $15 per set = 2 Lego sets.\n\nSince John started with 13 Lego sets and sold 2, we can find out how many Lego sets he still has: 13 - 2 =", "<reasoning>\nTo find John's speed, we need to calculate the total distance he runs in a week and then divide it by the total time he spends running. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total distance John runs in a week. He runs 60 miles a week. \n\nNext, let's calculate the total time John spends running. He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours on each of the other two days. The total time he spends running is 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 hours.\n\nNow, we can calculate John's speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. Speed = Distance / Time = 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.\n\nHowever, we need to find the speed for each day. Since he runs 3 hours the first day and 1.5 hours the other two days, we need to find the distance he runs on each day. \n\nThe distance he runs on the first day is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles. The distance he runs on each of the other", "## Step 1: Determine Dana's running speed\nSince Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run, and she can skip at 3 miles per hour, her running speed is twice her skipping speed. So, her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour.\n\n## Step 2: Determine Dana's walking speed\nDana can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk. Since her running speed is 6 miles per hour, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.\n\n## Step 3: Calculate the time spent running and walking\nDana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. If she spends a total of 6 hours, then she spends 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours running and 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.\n\n## Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled running\nDistance = speed * time.

The cost of the supplies is $10.00 per pound, so the total cost of the supplies is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.\n\nNext, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the candles. Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, and he wants to sell 20 candles. The total revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.\n\nNow, let's calculate the net profit. The net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost of the supplies. So, the net profit is $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00.\n\nHowever, since Charlie can make 10 candles with 1 pound of beeswax, he can make 20 candles with 2 pounds of beeswax.

So, she used 220 Post-it notes at work.\n\nWe also know that she had 80 Post-it notes initially and had 23 remaining after purchasing the package and using some Post-it notes at work. So, the total number of Post-it notes she used is 80 (initial) + 23 (remaining) = 103.\n\nNow, we can find the number of Post-it notes in the package by subtracting the initial number of Post-it notes from the total number of Post-it notes used: 103 (used) - 80 (initial) = 23.\n\nHowever, this is the number of Post-it notes she used from the package, not the total number of Post-it notes in the package.

The distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM is 10t miles.\n\nSince he traveled from 1 to 4 PM, the time he traveled is 3 hours. So, 10t = 10 * 3 = 30 miles.\n\nNow, we know the distance he needs to travel back is 30 miles, and his speed is 6 miles per hour. We can use the formula: time = distance / speed. So, time = 30 / 6 = 5 hours.\n\nHowever, this is the time it takes to travel back, but we need to add the time he already traveled from 1 to 4 PM, which is 3 hours.

Since it takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, half of that would be 2 / 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber. So, the total number of bolts of white fiber is 1. To find the total number of bolts, we add the bolts of blue fiber and white fiber: 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n3\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the profit Josh made, we need to first calculate the value of the house after the repairs.  The original value of the house was $80,000.  Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%.  This means the value of the house after repairs is 2.5 times the original value.  So, the value of the house after repairs is 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.  To find the profit, we need to subtract the cost of the house and the repairs from the value of the house after repairs.  The profit is $200,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $70,000.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n70000\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total meters James runs a week, we need to calculate the total meters he runs in one sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints he runs in a week.

Since each chicken eats 3 cups of feed per day, and there are 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed given in a day is 20 * 3 = 60 cups. In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups of feed, and in the afternoon, she gives 25 cups of feed. So, the total number of cups of feed given in the morning and afternoon is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. To find the number of cups of feed given in the final meal, we subtract 40 from 60, which is 20 cups.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n20\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total cost, we need to calculate the cost of the first glass and the cost of the remaining glasses. The first glass costs $5. The second glass costs 60% of $5, which is 0.6 * 5 = $3. Since the second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass, the third glass will cost 60% of $3, which is 0.6 * 3 = $1.8. This pattern continues, and the cost of each glass decreases by 40% of the previous glass's cost. So, the sequence of the cost of the glasses is $5, $3, $1.8, $1.08, $0.648, and so on. We need to find the sum of this geometric series. The first term (a) is $5, and the common ratio (r) is 0.6. The number of terms (n) is 16. The sum of a geometric series is given by the formula S = a * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r). Plugging in the values, we get S = 5 * (1 - 0.6^16) / (1 - 0.6). Calculating the value of 0.6^16, we get 0.00006103515625. Plugging this into the formula, we get S = 5 * (1 - 0.00006103515625) / (1 - 0.6) = 5 * 0.999938964744 = 4.99969472372. Since we are dealing with money, we round the answer to two decimal places. Therefore, the total cost is approximately $4.99. However, we need to add the cost of the first glass, which is $5.

Since he drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, the distance is 3 * 60 = 180 miles.\n\nWhen John turns around, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic. This means he doesn't cover any distance during this time.\n\nAfter the traffic, he drives at 30 mph for half an hour, so the distance covered in this time is 0.5 * 30 = 15 miles.\n\nThe remaining time he has to drive back home is 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. He drives at 80 mph during this time, so the distance covered is 1.5 * 80 = 120 miles.\n\nThe total distance John is from home at the end of those 4 hours is the sum of the distance he covered while driving to the point where he turns around and the distance he covered while driving back home.

The annual cost of maintaining the tree is $3. The income from selling the lemons each year is 7 lemons * $1.5 per lemon = $10.5 per year.\n\nWe need to find the point at which the total income from selling the lemons is greater than the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree.\n\nLet's calculate the total cost and income for each year:\n\nYear 1: Cost = $90 (planting) + $3 (maintenance) = $93, Income = $10.5\nYear 2: Cost = $93 + $3 = $96, Income = $21 (10.5 * 2)\nYear 3: Cost = $96 + $3 = $99, Income = $31.5 (10.5 * 3)\nYear 4: Cost = $99 + $3 = $102, Income = $42 (10.5 * 4)\nYear 5: Cost = $102 + $3 = $105, Income = $52.5 (10.5 * 5)\n\nWe can see that in the 5th year, the income ($52.5) is greater than the total cost ($105).

Since the orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in the orange drink is 6.67 liters. \n\nNext, we need to find the amount of water in the pineapple drink. Three-fifths of 15 liters is (3/5) * 15 = 45/5 = 9 liters. Since the pineapple drink is 3/5 water, the amount of water in the pineapple drink is 9 liters.\n\nNow, we need to find the total amount of water in both drinks before spilling any. The total amount of water is 6.67 + 9 = 15.67 liters.\n\nAfter spilling 1 liter of the orange drink, we need to subtract the water content of 1 liter from the total water content. Since 1 liter is 2/3 water, the amount of water spilled is (2/3) * 1 = 2/3 liter.\n\nThe total amount of water spilled is 2/3 liter. To find the amount of water left, we need to subtract 2/3 liter from 15.67 liters. To do this, we can convert 2/3 to a decimal, which is approximately 0.67. Then, we subtract 0.67 from 15.67, which is 15.\n\nHowever, we need to find the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters. Since we have 15 liters of pineapple drink and 9 liters of water in it, and we have 9 liters of orange drink left, we need to find the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange drink. Since 1 liter of orange drink is 2/3 water, the amount of water in 9 liters of orange drink is (2/3) * 9 = 6 liters.\n\nThe total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 15 + 6 = 21 liters.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n21\n</answer>", "REASONING\nTo find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to first determine Raymond's current age.

We know that his first stop was after 20 miles, and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. Since the total trip was 60 miles, the distance from the first stop to the second stop can be calculated by subtracting the distance traveled before the first stop and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip from the total trip distance. The distance traveled before the first stop is 20 miles, and the distance from the second stop to the end of the trip is 15 miles. So, the distance between the two stops is 60 - 20 - 15 = 25 miles.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n25\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nLet's denote the cost of the more expensive pair of heels as x. Since the other pair costs twice as much, its cost is 2x. Together, the two pairs of heels cost 5 dollars less than the boots. So, we can set up the equation: x + 2x = boots - 5. Combining like terms, we get 3x = boots - 5. We are also given that one pair of heels costs $33, so we can set up the equation x = 33. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get 3(33) = boots - 5. Simplifying, we get 99 = boots - 5. Adding 5 to both sides, we get 104 = boots.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n104\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nLet's assume Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. The total age of Darrell and Allen is 7x + 11x = 18x. We are given that their total age is 162, so 18x = 162. To find the value of x, we divide both sides by 18: x = 162 / 18 = 9. Now that we know the value of x, we can find Allen's age now: Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: Allen's age 10 years from now = 99 + 10 = 109.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n109\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the average guess, we need to calculate the total number of guesses and divide it by the number of guesses. \nThe first guess is 80. \nThe second guess is 20 more than half of the first one, which is (80 + 20)/2 = 50. \nThe third guess is 25% more than the first one, which is 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 100. \nSo the total number of guesses is 80 + 50 + 100 = 230. \nThere are 3 guesses. \nThe average guess is 230 / 3 = 76.67. \n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n76.67\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total hours John spends taking care of dogs in a week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent per dog per day, and then multiply the result by 7 (the number of days in a week). \n10 dogs * 0.5 hours/day = 5 hours/day\n5 hours/day * 7 days/week = 35 hours/week\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n35\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nLet's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

He sold 13 sets at $15 each, so the total amount of money he made is 13 * 15 = $195. Then, he bought 8 video games at $20 each, which cost him 8 * 20 = $160. After buying the video games, he had $5 left. So, the amount of money he had before buying the video games is $195 + $5 = $200. Since he spent $160 on video games, he must have had $200 - $160 = $40 left from the Lego sets. Since he sold the sets for $15 each, the number of sets he sold is $40 / $15 = 2.67. However, he can't sell a fraction of a set, so he must have sold 2 sets.

We want the average annual pension for the 30 years. To find the average annual pension, we need to find the total annual pension for the 30 years and divide it by 30.\n\nThe total annual pension for the 30 years is the sum of the annual pensions for the first 10 years and the next 20 years. The annual pension for the first 10 years is $50,000 * 10 = $500,000. The annual pension for the next 20 years is $50,000 * 20 = $1,000,000.\n\nThe total annual pension for the 30 years is $500,000 + $1,000,000 = $1,500,000.\n\nThe average annual pension is $1,500,000 / 30 = $50,000.\n\nHowever, this is the average annual pension. We want the annual pension after 30 years. Since she gets the increased pension after 20 years, we need to find the annual pension for the last year, which is the 30th year.\n\nThe annual pension for the 30th year is the increased pension, which is $50,000.\n\nBut we also need to consider the 5% increase. The 5% increase is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000. However, this is the increase for the 20 years. We need to find the increase for the 10 years after the 20 years.\n\nThe increase for the 10 years is 0.05 * $1,000,000 = $50,000.\n\nThe total increase is $50,000 + $50,000 = $100,000.\n\nThe annual pension after 30 years is $50,000 + $100,000 = $150,000.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n150000\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to calculate the amount she paid for the first half of the year and the amount she paid for the second half of the year. \n\nThe first half of the year is 6 months, so the amount she paid for the first half is 6 * $140 = $840. \n\nThe amount she paid for the second half of the year is 10% less than $140, which is 0.9 * $140 = $126. \n\nSo, the amount she paid for the second half of the year is $126 * 6 = $756. \n\nThe total amount she paid for the year is $840 + $756 = $1596. \n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n1596\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to determine the car's miles per gallon (mpg) rating. We know that she traveled 100 miles on 4 gallons of gas. We can use this information to calculate the car's mpg rating. Then, we can multiply this rating by the total capacity of the gas tank to find out how many miles she can drive on a full tank.\n\nFirst, we calculate the car's mpg rating: 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 mpg.\n\nNext, we multiply the mpg rating by the total capacity of the gas tank: 25 mpg * 12 gallons = 300 miles.\n\nTherefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n300\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total hours spent on TV and reading, we need to calculate the total hours spent in one week and then multiply it by 4. \nFirst, let's calculate the total hours spent in one week. Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then reads for half as long, which is 2 / 2 = 1 hour. So, in one day, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours. Since he does this 3 times a week, the total hours spent in one week is 3 * 3 = 9 hours. \nNow, we multiply the total hours spent in one week by 4 to get the total hours spent in 4 weeks. 9 * 4 = 36 hours.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n36\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nThere are 4 schools, each with 2 teams (girls and boys) and each team has 5 players and 1 coach.

She receives $5 per week for 8 weeks, so she earns 5 * 8 = $40. At the end of the 8 weeks, she has a total of $100, which is the sum of her initial amount and the amount she earned. So, we can set up the equation: x + 40 = 100. To find the initial amount, we need to subtract 40 from both sides of the equation, which gives us x = 100 - 40 = 60.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n60\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find out how much money Judy makes in a week, we need to calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week and multiply it by the number of students per class and the charge per student. \nThere are 5 classes per day for 5 days (Monday to Friday), which is 5 * 5 = 25 classes. \nOn Saturday, she teaches 8 classes. \nSo, the total number of classes in a week is 25 + 8 = 33 classes. \nEach class has 15 students, so the total number of students per week is 33 * 15 = 495 students. \nSince she charges $15 per student, the total amount she makes in a week is 495 * $15 = $7355. \n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n7355\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total number of instructions, we need to add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

The total cost of the cell phones is 5 * $150 = $750. Since a 2% interest will be charged for each unit, the interest for each cell phone is $150 * 0.02 = $3. So the total interest for all 5 cell phones is $3 * 5 = $15. The total amount Shiela needs to pay is $750 + $15 = $765. Since the installment is for 3 months, the amount Shiela will pay each month is $765 / 3 = $255.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n255\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find out how much Artie will make, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of flower and then add them together. \n\nFirst, we round the prices to the nearest dollar: marigolds are $2, petunias are $1.87 rounded to $2, and begonias are $2.12 rounded to $2.\n\nThe total revenue from marigolds is 12 * $2 = $24.\nThe total revenue from petunias is 9 * $2 = $18.\nThe total revenue from begonias is 17 * $2 = $34.\n\nNow, we add the revenues together: $24 + $18 + $34 = $76.\n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n76\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the average square footage of a level, we need to first find the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

The puppy eats 1 cup of dog food for the first 180 days. After that, it eats 2 cups of dog food per day for the rest of its life. Since there are 365 days in a year, the puppy eats 2 cups of dog food for 365 - 180 = 185 days. The total number of cups of dog food the puppy will eat in the first year is 180 * 1 + 185 * 2 = 180 + 370 = 550 cups. Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the total number of bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year is 550 / 110 = 5 bags.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n5\n</answer>", "If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David does 400 / 4 = 100 pounds of laundry.\nIf Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, then Raymond does 400 / 2 = 200 pounds of laundry.\nThe difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.\n<reasoning>\nTo find the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we first need to find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we divide the amount of laundry Sarah does by 4. Then we find out how much laundry Raymond does by dividing the amount of laundry Sarah does by 2. Finally, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does to find the difference.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n100\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the better price, we need to calculate the cost per flower for each package. For the package of 3 flowers, the cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.833. For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.5. Since $0.5 is less than $0.833, the package of 2 flowers is the better price. To find the cost of 18 flowers at the better price, we multiply the cost per flower by the number of flowers: 18 * $0.5 = $9. To find the cost of 18 flowers at the worse price, we multiply the cost per flower by the number of flowers: 18 * $0.833 = $15.

We know that the total number of games played is 22, so L + W = 22. We also know that the team won 8 more games than they lost, so W = L + 8. We can substitute the second equation into the first one: L + (L + 8) = 22. Simplifying this equation, we get 2L + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2L = 14. Dividing both sides by 2, we get L = 7. Now that we know L, we can find W by substituting L into one of the original equations: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n15\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nTo find the total number of quilt blocks, we need to calculate the total number of years Gene has been vacationing and multiply it by the number of vacations he takes per year.

Since she gets a 10% increase every year for five years, we need to apply the increase five times. \n\nInitially, her salary is $600. After the first year, her salary will be 600 + (600 * 0.10) = $660. After the second year, her salary will be 660 + (660 * 0.10) = $726. After the third year, her salary will be 726 + (726 * 0.10) = $802. After the fourth year, her salary will be 802 + (802 * 0.10) = $884. After the fifth year, her salary will be 884 + (884 * 0.10) = $973.20.\n\nSince she stays for three more years, she will get another 10% increase every year. After the sixth year, her salary will be 973.20 + (973.20 * 0.10) = $1073.92. After the seventh year, her salary will be 1073.92 + (1073.92 * 0.10) = $1183.92. After the eighth year, her salary will be 1183.92 + (1183.92 * 0.10) = $1304.92.\n\nSo, her annual salary after three more years of service will be $1304.92.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n1305\n</answer>", "<reasoning>\nLet's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H.

So, we can try 12 vacuum cleaners. \n12 - 4 = 8. \n8 - 2 = 6. \n6/2 = 3. \n8 + 2 + 3 = 13. \n12 - 13 = -1. \n-1 is not equal to 5. So, 12 is not the correct answer. \nHowever, 12.5 is close to 12. So, we can try 12 + 1 = 13 vacuum cleaners. \n13 - 4.33 = 8.67. \n8.67 - 2 = 6.67. \n6.67/2 = 3.33. \n8.67 + 2 + 3.33 = 14. \n14 - 13 = 1. \n1 is not equal to 5. So, 13 is not the correct answer. \nHowever, 12.5 is close to 13. So, we can try 12.5 + 1 = 13.5 vacuum cleaners. \n13.5 - 4.5 = 9. \n9 - 2 = 7. \n7/2 = 3.5. \n9 + 2 + 3.5 = 14.5. \n14.5 - 13.5 = 1. \n1 is not equal to 5. So, 13.5 is not the correct answer. \nHowever, 12.5 is close to 13.5. So, we can try 12.5 + 2 = 14.5 vacuum cleaners. \n14.5 - 4.83 = 9.67. \n9.67 - 2 = 7.67. \n7.67/2 = 3.835. \n9.67 + 2 + 3.835 = 15.515. \n15.515 - 14.5 = 1.015. \n1.015 is not equal to 5. So, 14.5 is not the correct answer. \nHowever, 12.5 is close to 14.5.

So, 17.5 is not the correct answer. \nHowever, 12.5 is close to 17.5. So, we can try 12.5 + 2.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 17.5 + 0.5 = 18 vacuum cleaners. \n18 - 5 = 13. \n13 - 2 = 11. \n11/2 = 5.5. \n18 + 2 + 5.5 = 25.5. \n25.5 - 18 = 7.5. \n7.5 is not equal to 5. So, 18 is not the correct answer. \nHowever, 12.5 is close to 18. So, we can try 12.5 + 2.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 18 + 0.5 = 18.5 vacuum cleaners. \n18.5 - 5 = 13.5. \n13.5 - 2 = 11.5. \n11.5/2 = 5.75. \n18.5 + 2 + 5.75 = 26.25. \n26.25 - 18.5 = 7.75. \n7.75 is not equal to 5. So, 18.5 is not the correct answer. \nHowever, 12.5 is close to 18.5. So, we can try 12.5 + 2.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 = 18.5 + 0.5 = 19 vacuum cleaners. \n19 - 5 = 14. \n14 - 2 = 12. \n12/2 = 6. \n19 + 2 + 6 = 27. \n27 - 19 = 8. \n8 is not equal to 5.
